### Lincoln's Gettysburg Address as Fluid Text

### My Understanding of the Gettysburg Address

- I find the use and nonuse of the phrase "under God" throughout the different copies of Lincoln's Gettysburg Address interesting. It is found in the Bliss, Brancroft, and Everett versions, but not in the Nicolay and Hay versions. To me, its use implies that Lincoln saw the Civil War as a purification of sorts, regardless of the political tensions. Perhaps he saw it as the nation being reborn and collectively moving forward.
However, I do not find that my understanding of Lincoln's message was severely affected. Since the changes are subtle, the overall meaning is kept intact.
