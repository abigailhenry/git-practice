### Working with IIIF Images

- IIIF = International Image Interoperability Framework
- High quality scans of manuscripts that researchers can examine in detail
- Calling an image at full size = use default link
- Calling an image at a percentage of its size = change this part of the link: *full/pct:[whatever % you want]/0/*
- Rotating an image = change the 0 after the size

### URl Syntax

- Basic Template: {scheme}://{server}{/prefix}/{identifier}/{region}/{size}/{rotation}/{quality}.{format}

### How to Include an Image

- img src="url" with <> brackets

### Walden Manuscript Image

- Page 88 of *Walden* Version A (10% of full size)
 <img src="https://cdm16003.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/iiif/p16003coll16/95/full/pct:10/0/default.jpg">

- Rotated Image: Page 14 of *Walden* Version B-C (10% of full size)
<img src="https://cdm16003.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/iiif/p16003coll16/270/full/pct:10/90/default.jpg">
