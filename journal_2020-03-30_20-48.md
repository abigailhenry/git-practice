### What is a Fluid Text?

- A work that is the product of multiple revisions
- Some revisions reflect author's conception of the work
- Some revisions reflect the author's edits/fine-tuning
- A work may be changed over time - technically never final
- Ex: Thoreau edited *Walden* ~8 times

### My Own Fluid Text Example

  If I had to illustrate the concept of "fluid text" to someone using an example other than Walden, I think that I would use The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho. I had to read it as a part of my English class my junior year of high school. 

It is fluid in the way that it was originally written and published in Portuguese, and has been translated into several other languages over time. It has also been adapted into a comic/graphic and theatrical form.

I think it is important to recognize the fluidity of this novel as it has endured many adaptations, most of them being language related, so some aspects may have been changed or lost due to details not fully translating. Different cultures each have their own sayings and phrases. In addition, Coelho wrote the The Alchemist in only two weeks, claiming that the story was "already written in his soul". I believe that this is key in its fluidity, too. Since the story is very spiritual and near to Coelho's beliefs, one's perspective may be unlike what Coelho had intended.
